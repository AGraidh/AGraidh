- 👋 Hi, I’m @AGraidh.
- 👀 I find game-development related software interesting, but currently in a course going towards AI or logic-based problem-solving stuff
- 🌱 Pretty lost, but Computer Science is fun and developing/debugging code is a challenge that feels rewarding: all-in-all good.
- 💞️ Love to work with others for a common goal; just have to find that community.
- 📫 You could email me on amvgraidh@gmail.com
- OCL'er for lyfe <3 ☝🤓
