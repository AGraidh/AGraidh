- 👋 Hi, I’m @AGraidh.
- 👀 I find game-development related software interesting, but currently in a course going towards ...
- 🌱 studying AI in my 3rd year. Pretty unsure, but Computer Science is fun and developing/debugging code is a challenge that feels rewarding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on maybe a modding community? Something akin to Nexus I guess? Otherwise I still need to tone up on my coding lol.
- 📫 You could email me on amvgraidh@gmail.com
